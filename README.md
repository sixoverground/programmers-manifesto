# The Programmer's Manifesto

*Our philosophy on programming at Six Overground*

## The best programming language is the one which gets to market first, without sacrificing user experience.

## Done is better than perfect, if all functional requirements are met.

## Write legible, modular, performant code.

## Know design, respect design, and adhere to the project design.

## Don't reinvent the wheel.
